          <span style="font-weight: 700">Wow!</span> This year has been a crazy and challenging one! Managing the ups
          and downs of a global pandemic has certainly been interesting, however fortunately here at Zyrous we managed
          to weather most of it by already being a digital native cloud company. Operating as a fully remote working
          company meant that ultimately didnâ€™t miss a beat. Whilst like the rest of the world we did notice a slowing of
          new work, we still managed to conquer some amazing feats and want to thank you for the work that was achieved
          and successfully delivered. A few projects that were closed out in 2020 being Crowdpop, EDGE, EAA, TII and for
          these we say <span style="font-weight: 700">Thank you!</span> At the same time still committing to our own
          internal projects for the new Zyrous website and our Kolabree project!

          Our staff is the best around. You deserve time with family and friends to enjoy this holiday season. We wish
          you happiness, good health, and peace. We truly thank you for your devoted service to Zyrous. With this in
          mind, we would like to call out our
          <span style="color: #0be6e9; font-weight: 700"
            >2 week shutdown period within Zyrous which will be from the 18th December to the 4th January.</span

          We expect everyone to have time off for the shutdown unless specifically asked based on the project work they
          are on.

          We are looking forward to a big year next year based on the work pipeline we are standing up. We have a great
          project with the Western Australian Health Department where we are getting going and as we are ramping up
          marketing for Zyrous, we are looking and growing the company through 2021.
